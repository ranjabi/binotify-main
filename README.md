# Binotify Main

Binotify is a music streaming application that operates similarly to Spotify. 

The application's backend is designed using microservices, such as REST API and SOAP, to ensure efficient and reliable performance. 

The frontend of the application consists of two separate websites. The primary website, which is built using PHP, is responsible for displaying the songs to the users, while the second website, built with ReactJS, acts as a content management system for the songs. 

The entire infrastructure of the application is built on Docker, making it easy to manage and deploy all the services.
